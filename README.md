ðŸ“–Introduction: This data set contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things. All personally identifying information has been removed from the data.

ðŸ“–Problem Statement: Have you ever wondered when the best time of year to book a hotel room is? Or the optimal length of stay in order to get the best daily rate? What if you wanted to predict whether or not a hotel was likely to receive a disproportionately high number of special requests? This hotel booking dataset can help you explore those questions!

ðŸ“–Tools and Libraries Used: Pandas for data manipulation,aggregation
 NumPy for computationally efficient operations
 Matplotlib and Seaborn for Data visualization and behaviour with respect to the target variable.
